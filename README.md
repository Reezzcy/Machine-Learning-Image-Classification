# Image Classification Project

## Project Description

This project aims to classify images into three categories: scissors, stone, or paper. The images will be processed and fed into an image recognition model using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. The model will be trained using a dataset of images that have been labeled for each category. The model will learn to extract features from the images and make predictions about which category each image corresponds to.

## Objective
- Developed an automatic image classification system to identify images of scissors, stone, or paper.
- Using TensorFlow and neural network models to build an efficient and accurate image classification model.
- Explore different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the image classification model.

## Tools
- Google Colaboratory
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib
- Numpy
- Ziplife
